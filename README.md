## TAGBOTS: Multiple robots chasing human players

Introducing "Tagbot" â€“ our innovative project where robotics meets fun and fitness. Unlike typical indoor robotics activities, Tagbot takes tech outdoors, encouraging kids to dive into STEM learning while staying active.

Our mission is to create robots that can play tag with kids. With Tagbot, children don't just learn science and tech; they move, strategize, and grow holistically.
